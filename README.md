# React Business Card
A light-hearted, friendly but slightly bold business card designed by using React as the base framework!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Figma, JavaScript, React

A static frontend application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React with retrieving the base design off of Figma. I designed this project by using a color scheme that "highlights me" as an individual; a soft but slightly bold color, whilst taking the background of the headshot in to consideration. I used React to organize the different sections of the business card to shape the card in to what is seen in the photo. I used JSX within React to write in the base text and styling of the card as well.   

## Lessons Learned:

React is quite complex in of itself. I (re-)learned how to use components and organize them correctly so that all of the files can see each other. I also refreshed myself of the knowledge of when utilizing React, to NOT put the images in the src folder, but to put them in to the public folder. I hit a little snafu wondering why my images were not rendering, thus, this was the reason why.
